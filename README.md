# [Flappy Chris](http://kennygscott.github.io/flappy-chris/)

Flappy Chris is a lazily strung together addictive adventure into the world of community college, philly cheesesteaks, and lobster tails. It is a comical homage to my fellow CTEC students and our instructors. 

It is and was done poorly intentionally as part of the joke.

## Inception

Flappy Chris is an amalgamation of a few friendly insults, inside jokes and many other miscellaneous interactions between myself, other students, and the two absolutely wonderful instructors that inspired this with their antics, Chris and Bruce. 

## Major Bugs/Fixes/Updates Coming Soon, Probably...well, probably never.

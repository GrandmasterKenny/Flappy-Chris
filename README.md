# [Flappy Chris](http://flappychris.design-ninja.net)

Flappy Chris is an addictive adventure into the world of community college, philly cheesesteaks, and lobster tails. It is a comical homage to my fellow CTEC students and our instructors.

##Inception

Flappy Chris is an amalgamation of a few insults, inside jokes and many other miscellaneous interactions between myelf, other students, and two wily, mischievous instructors, Chris and Bruce. 

##Major Bugs/Fixes/Updates Coming Soon

1. ~~Sprite collision detection issue; Sprite bounds are non-consistent with the sprite image itself.~~ I modified the sprite, but decided to keep the bounds a little crazy to make the game sufficiently obnoxious.
2. ~~Mobile - Sound does not function properly.~~
Note About Sound: Only mobile devices with HTML5 audio support will play the sound correctly (until I port this over to Java)
3. Audio levels need to be normalized and adjusted.
4. Addition of high score table

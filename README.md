# [Flappy Chris](http://grandmasterkenny.github.io/flappy-chris/)

Flappy Chris is a lazily strung together addictive adventure into the world of community college, philly cheesesteaks, and lobster tails. It is a comical homage to my fellow CTEC students and our instructors.

##Inception

Flappy Chris is an amalgamation of a few insults, inside jokes and many other miscellaneous interactions between myself, other students, and two interesting, mischievous instructors, Chris and Bruce. 

##Major Bugs/Fixes/Updates Coming Soon, Probably...well, probably never.
